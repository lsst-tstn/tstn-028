   **This technote is not yet published.**

   This technote gathers information about the history, current state and contemplates future evolutions of the Vera Rubin Observatory Control System (Rubin-OCS) Middleware. The middleware is the backbone of the Rubin-OCS. The highly distributed nature of the Rubin-OCS places tight constraints in terms of latency, availability and reliability for the middleware. Here we gather information to answer some common questions regarding technology choices, describe some of the in-house work done to obtain a stable system and document some of the concerns with the current state of the system, potential impacts for near-future/commissioning and future/operations. We also cover some of the work we have been doing to investigate alternative technologies and suggest some potential roadmaps for the future of the system.
